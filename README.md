#Canada Time Tracker

This application rose out of a need to find a much better solution to track the number of days my company's employees spent
in Canada. The current method is *cumbersome* as there is no automatic method to keep track of the number of days one spends 
in Canada. The best solution is to update a calendar on an Excel document. 

This application will hopefully solve that problem.
